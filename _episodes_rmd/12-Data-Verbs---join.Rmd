```

All the functions we have looked at so far work with a single data frame and modify it in some way.
It is common, however, that your data may not be stored in a single, complete, form and instead will
be found in a number of places. Perhaps measurements taken in different weeks have been saved to 
separate places, or maybe you have different files recording observations and metadata. To work with
data stored like this it is necessary to learn how to combine and merge different datasets into a
single data frame.

## Combining data

If you have new data that has the same structure as your old data, it can be added onto the end of 
your data frame with `bind_rows()`. We have collected the [gapminder data for 2012]({{ page.root }}{% link data/gapminder_2012.csv %}) 
into a separate file for you to practice this with. Download this file and save it in your data
directory as `gapminder_2012.csv`.

```{r bind}
gapminder_2012 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_2012.csv")

gapminder_2012
```

> ## Challenge 1
> Combine the 2012 data with your gapminder data using `bind_rows(gapminder, gapminder_2012)`.
> 
> Explore the resulting data frame to see the effect of `bind_rows()`. 
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1
> > ```{r join-sol-1}
> > combined_gapminder <- bind_rows(gapminder, gapminder_2012)
> > 
> > tail(combined_gapminder)
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

The columns are matched by name, so you need to make sure that both data frames are named 
consistently. If the names do not match, the data frames will still be bound together but any missing
data will be replaced with `NA`s

```{r bind-2}
renamed_2012 <- rename(gapminder_2012, population = pop)

mismatched_names <- bind_rows(gapminder, renamed_2012)

mismatched_names

tail(mismatched_names)
```

## Merging data

If you are instead looking to merge data sets based on some shared variable, there are a number of
`join`s that are useful. The [tidyexplain](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain) package has a
number of animations that will help us understand what is happening with each join.

Let's start with two simple data frames that have one shared column indicating a shared ID:

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/original-dfs.png %}){:width="50%"}

The first join we will look at is an `inner_join()`. This function takes two data frames as input and
merges them based on their shared column. Only rows with data in *both* data frames are kept.

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/inner-join.gif %}){:width="50%"}

The opposite of an `inner_join()` is a `full_join()`. This function keeps all rows from both data 
frames, filling in any missing data with `NA`.

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/full-join.gif %}){:width="50%"}

The final join we will look at is a `left_join()`. This uses the first data frame as a reference and
merges in data from the second data frame. Any rows that are in the left data frame but not the right
are filled in with `NA`. Any rows in the right data frame but not the left are ignored.

![]({{ page.root }}{% link fig/left-join.gif %}){:width="50%"}

For the sake of completeness, there are also functions for a `right_join()`, `semi_join()`, and
`anti_join()`. But we will not go into how they work because they are far less commonly needed than
the three above.

> ## Challenge 2
> Create the following two data frames:
> ```{r join-chal-1}
> df1 <- tibble(sample = c(1, 2, 3), measure1 = c(4.2, 5.3, 6.1))
> df2 <- tibble(sample = c(1, 3, 4), measure2 = c(7.8, 6.4, 9.0))
> ```
>
> Predict the result of running `inner_join()`, `full_join()`, and `left_join()` on these two data 
> frames. Perform the joins to see if you are correct.
> > ## Solution to Challenge 2
> > ```{r join-sol-2}
> > inner_join(df1, df2)
> > full_join(df1, df2)
> > # df1 as left data frame
> > left_join(df1, df2)
> > # df2 as left data frame
> > left_join(df2, df1)
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

By default, the `join` functions will join based on any shared column names between the two data 
frames (here just the `sample` column). You may have noticed the helpful message providing information
about how the join was performed: `Joining, by = "sample"`. You can control which columns are used 
to merge with the `by` argument. 

```{r join-by-arg}
full_join(df1, df2, by = c("sample"))
```

This may be useful if the data frames share a number of column names, bu only some of them should be
used for merging. You can also use it to merge on a column even if the names don't match between the 
data frames. In this case you need to specify `by = c("left_name" = "right_name")`:

```{r join-by-diff-names}
df3 = tibble(ID = c(1, 2, 4), measure3 = c(4.7, 3.5, 9.3))

# Can't do it automatically
full_join(df1, df3)

# name in df1 is "sample", name in df3 is "ID"
full_join(df1, df3, by = c("sample" = "ID"))
```

## Realistic data
For a more realistic example of joins, let's turn back to the gapminder data. We have some additional
data on [countries sex ratios]({{ page.root }}{% link data/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv %}) that you should
download and save to your data folder. 

Read it in and let's join it to our existing data.

```{r join-read-sex-ratio}
gapminder_sr <- read_csv("data/gapminder_sex_ratios.csv")
gapminder_sr
```

> ## Challenge 3
> Which columns are shared between `gapminder` and `gapminder_sr`?. 
>
> Compare the output of `left`, `full` and `inner` joins for these two datasets. You may notice that it is possible to join on multiple columns. 
> For example:
> ~~~~
> full_join(gapminder, gapminder_sr)
> ~~~~ 
> What are the differences between these three joins? What causes these differences?
> > ## Solution to Challenge 3
> > The two datasets share the `country` and `year` columns.
> > 
> > The output from `full_join` has the most rows, because it is keeping all the rows from both 
> > dataframes. `inner_join` is only including those rows that match. and has the least rows. The 
> > `left_join` output will depend on which data frame was provided first and has the same number of
> > rows as that data frame.
