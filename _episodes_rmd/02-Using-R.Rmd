## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:
Open an R script, save it, and type in the following:

```{r basic1}
1 + 100
```
Send this command to the R console to be executed with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>.

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

What happens if your command is incomplete? Try writing this in a script and running it with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can simply hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> and RStudio will give you back the ">"
prompt.

> You can also cancel commands using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
> This applies to Mac users as well!

> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect).

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`

```{r basic2}
3 + 5 * 2
```

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.

```{r basic3}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
```


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:

```{r basic4}
2/10000
```

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:

```{r basic5}
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
```


## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:

```{r basic6}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r basic7}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r basic8}
1 < 2  # less than
```

```{r basic9}
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

```{r basic10}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r assignment1}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r assignment2}
x
```

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r log}
log(x)
```

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:

```{r reassignment}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:

```{r assignment3}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

## Missing data

For all data types, it is possible to have missing values. In R, missing values are represented as `NA`. It is very important to understand this is different to `0`, or `""`, which are each values in themselves. `NA` means **missing** (or not available). 

If you want to check whether the variable `x` is `NA` it would be natural to use the equality operator (`==`):

```{r equality-na}
x <- NA
x == NA
```

Using `==` with `NA` returns `NA`, because making a comparison to a missing value doesn't make sense. Instead we need to check for the "state of missingness" rather than a value. We can do this with the `is.na()` function:

```{r is.na}
x <- NA
is.na(x)
```

### Naming things

Object names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, which include:

```{r naming, eval=FALSE}
this_is_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```

Hadley Wickham recommends `snake_case`. What you use is up 
to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

```{r equal_assignment}
x = 1/40
```

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

## Commenting

Comments are 'notes' that are added to your script to provide further details for a human to read. 
They are ignored by R when the code is run.  To add comments to your code,
just type a `#` before your note text.

It's a good habit to get into writing comments about what the code you're writing is for - think of them as notes to help a future user (probably you!) understand why the code is there.

```{r comments, error=TRUE}
# this is a comment line
# a <- 5 this code will not assign 5 to the variable a
a <- 5 #but this line will
```

## Functions

Functions are a stored list of instructions that can be "called" by a user. R has lots of built in functions to perform many different tasks. 

To call a function, we type its name, followed by open and closing parentheses, like `function_name()`. 

Many functions take *arguments*, which are a list of parameters that can be given to the function to modify its behaviour. In R, argument values are defined with an `=` sign, in the form of: `function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2)`. 

Some functions have some arguments that must be defined, and others that are optional.

> sequences of numbers, type `se` and hit TAB.  RStudio will provide a popup which will show

{: .callout}


```{r seq}
seq(1, 10)  # seq function
```

Typing a `?` before the name of a function will open its help page. As well as providing a detailed description of
the function and how it works, scrolling to the bottom of the
help page will usually show a collection of code examples which
illustrate function usage.


## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we simply type its name, followed by  open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:

```{r sin}
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
```

```{r log2}
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
```

```{r exp}
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
```

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors (which we'll describe soon) as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the 
same data type. For example

```{r vectorization}
1:5
2^(1:5)
x <- 1:5
2^x
```

This is incredibly powerful and makes for efficient and readable code.

## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with objects available in an R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r ls}
ls()
```

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!

```{r ls2}
ls
```

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:

```{r rm}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:

```{r rm2}
rm(list = ls())
```

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r rm3, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

## Packages

In R, a package is a collection of functions and documentation that are bundled together to provide some functionality. They are a convenient and standardised way for the community to share code with each other. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

Before we go on, make sure you have the `tidyverse` package installed. You can check by running `library(tidyverse)`, and if it's not available, you can install it with `install.packages(tidyverse)`.
